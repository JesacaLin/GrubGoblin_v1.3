# GrubGoblin v1.3: Track, Share, and Devour Deals!

GrubGoblin is a full-stack web application under development, designed to empower users to discover and manage delicious food deals. This project showcases a robust architecture utilizing modern web technologies.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Leverages a RESTful API built with Spring Boot for efficient data management. 
- **Database**: Employs PostgreSQL, a relational database, for secure and scalable data storage of food deals, user information, location information, and reviews.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Implements the MVC design pattern to ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainability between the data (Model), presentation (View), and user interaction (Controller) layers of the application.
- **Authentication**: Enforces secure user access with robust authentication mechanisms, ensuring only authorized users can access and manage their data.

## Current Functionality

- **CRUD Operations**: Provides a comprehensive API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting deals (CRUD) using the RESTful approach.
- **Advanced Search**: Empowers users to search for deals by day, type (food, drinks, etc.), location, rating (including top-rated), and reviews.
- **Review System**: Allows users to leave reviews on deals, fostering a collaborative community around food exploration.
- **Early Stage Google Maps Integration**: Utilizes the Google Maps API to convert addresses to latitude and longitude coordinates, laying the groundwork for future location-based features.
- **Comprehensive API Documentation**: GrubGoblin provides detailed API documentation, outlining all available endpoints and their functionalities related to deal management, user authentication, reviews, etc.

## Envisioned Future

- **Frontend Development**: A full-featured frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js, culminating in a Progressive Web App (PWA) for an exceptional user experience on mobile and desktop.
- **Social Sharing**: An integrated social aspect will allow users to share their favorite deals with neighbors, fostering community and restaurant discovery.
- **Location-Based Search**: Leveraging Google Maps integration, users can discover nearby deals based on their current location.
